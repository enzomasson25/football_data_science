# football_data_science

The aim of this project is to create a dataset of the english's football clubs. In this dataset you will find several clubs, sorted by division and then by name. 

To do this work, we used this website : http://fchd.info which contains a great number of english football clubs and reference the history of them.

In the first time, we took the last season in terms of date (ie 2018-2019).
